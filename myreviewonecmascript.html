        <h1 align="center" style="font-size:50px"> <u>Ecmascript </u></h1>
        <p align="center" style="font-size:20px"> Vanilla java script simply means plain java script just like the vanilla flavored ice cream it has a plain flavor.<br>
        Using plain js without libraries and framework is so bland , dry and boring. Javascript was written by Brendan Eich of netscape communications for just 10 days .<br>
        There were lots of conflicts before javascript was born.
        Developers did not give respect because it is a tool for the web designers for their websites.<br>But now, they started to take it seriously.
        Javascript was not just a browser-specific language but also a server-side language.<br>
         The popularity of javascript grew. Javascript rules over the browser for front/back end development, 
        server-side and also IoT devices.<br><br>
        
        I know that javascript is a stable language, but due to the pandemic, it is going down. This information is given by the video <br>I just watched and I really agreed with him.
        He compared js to other programming languages, <br>and the results are just the same 
        like c++, java, and PHP but for python, it is more papular than javascript.<br><br>

        Javascript is 25years old and still it is the most important programming language in the world because if there is no javascript we can't use
        the full features of a certain website.
