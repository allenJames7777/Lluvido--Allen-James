        <p>Wilhelm Roentgen, Professor of Physics in Wurzburg, Bavaria, discovered X-rays in 1895<br>
            X-rays can check much of the body. They're mostly used to check at bones and joints,<br> but they may also look at soft tissue, 
            including internal organs. <br>X-rays may identify bone fractures and breaks.

        <p>Invented by Samuel Siegfried Karl Ritter von Basch in the year 1881.<br> 
            Scipione Riva-Rocci introduced a more easily used version in 1896.<br>
            a device used to measure blood pressure, composed of an inflatable cuff to collapse and <br>
            then release the artery under the cuff in a controlled manner, and a mercury or aneroid manometer<br>

        <p>Ian Donald introduced the ultrasound in diagnostic and medicine in 1956,<br>
             when he used the one-dimensional A-mode (amplitude mode) <br>
             to measure the parietal diameter of the fetal head.An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves <br>
             to make an image of a person's internal body structures. Doctors commonly use ultrasound to study a developing fetus (unborn baby).<br>

        <p> (MRI) is a type of scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body.<br> 
            An MRI scanner is a large tube that contains powerful magnets. You lie inside the tube during the scan.
