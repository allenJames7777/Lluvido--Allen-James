<h1>Short story</h1>
<p id>On April 1, 1942, Desmond Doss joined the United States Army. Little did he realize that three and a half years later, he would be standing on the White House lawn, receiving the nation's highest award for his bravery and courage under fire.
    Of the 16 million men in uniform during World War II, only 431 received the Congressional Medal of Honor.
     One of these was placed around the neck of a young Seventh-day Adventist, who during combat had not killed a single enemy soldier. In fact, he refused to carry a gun.
      His only weapons were his Bible and his faith in God.</p>

<h1>Post-War Life</h1>
<p id>After the war, Doss initially planned to continue his career in carpentry, but extensive damage to his left arm made him unable to do so.
    He underwent treatment for five and a half years – which cost him a lung and five ribs – before being discharged from the hospital in August 1951 with 90% disability. 
    Doss continued to receive treatment from the military, but after an overdose of antibiotics rendered him completely deaf in 1976, he was given 100% disability;
     he was able to regain his hearing after receiving a cochlear implant in 1988. Doss died on March 23, 2006,After being hospitalized for difficulty breathing.</p>
